Python weekend NEKiwi.com - NEEEntry task

Budliky Budliky

By solving this task, you will prove to us and yourself, that you are familiar with the basics of python, in which case we believe that you will enjoy the weekend workshop and it won't be too hard or too boring for you.

Requirements
python-2 or 3 (but you know the right choice here ;-) )
all modules are allowed
Description
You have data about flights (segments). Your task is to find all combinations of flights for passengers with no bags, one bag or two bags are able to travel, having 1 to 4 hours for each transfer between flights. The columns in table of input data are explained bellow:

source, destination are the code of airport the flight is departing from and arriving to
departure, arrival are times of departure and arrival
price is the price of flight per person (without baggage)
bags_allowed the number of bags passenger is allowed to take with them
bag_price additional price per each bag passenger would like to take with them
flight_number is the unique identifier of each flight
For easy navigation in offered flight combinations (itineraries), it would be nice to show total prices to passengers that already include the additional price for bags, given they input how many bags they wish to take when they search for flights.

Input data (example)
source,destination,departure,arrival,flight_number,price,bags_allowed,bag_price

Kuk - Output
Output data should be in a format that is suitable for further processing
Don't make passengers travel trough the same cities in same trip:
A->B->A->B is not a valid combination
A->B->A is a valid combination

Solving
The task has been designed such that it provides a challenge to someone who has only recently familiarized themselves with python and provides a chance to use basic data types and control structures (if, for, etc.). Most people who have been programming in other languages won't have problems solving it and get a chance to try the python syntax.
The solution should be simple
We don't expect the solution to be optimized for computational complexity or memory usage (however if it's your thing, you may)

Usage
Input data will be fed into your program through stdin so it should be possible to run it in command line via a command such as cat input.csv | find_combinations.py. The output of your program will be printed to stdout and any errors will go to stderr.
